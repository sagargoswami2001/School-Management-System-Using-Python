# About School Management System:

School Management Systems manage all the information of the students and/or faculty in a particular school. In our project, we will only use it to manage some basic personal information of the students of a school.

# Project Prerequisites

To build this project, we will need the following libraries:
1. __Tkinter__ – To create the GUI.
2. __SQLite3__ – To connect the program to the database and store information in it.
3. __TkCalender__ – To get the user to enter a date.
4. __Datetime.date__ – To convert the date from the tree to a Datetime.date instance so that it can be set in.
5. __Tkinter.messagebox__ – To show a display box, displaying some information or an error.
6. __Tkinter.ttk__ – To create the tree where all the information will be displayed.
